# Arrays
Basic Array reference

More content will be added. 

A Starter reference for future content about arrays. Working on my work flow, time management, and project management. Another custom 
HTML and CSS background for project references. No one without the other. 

# Update 

Experimenting with the unicode characters.

Up2: Adding more unicode for references plus a media query for style responsiveness.

Up3: Making notes of some unicode characters. This needs to be changed for clarity and organization. :note;-) 'task attention'.

Up4: File clean up, and changes.
