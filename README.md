# Arrays
Basic Array reference

More content will be added. 

A Starter reference for future content about arrays. Working on my work flow, time management, and project management. Another custom 
HTML and CSS background for project references. No one without the other. 

# Update 

Experimenting with the unicode characters.

U2: Adding more unicode for references plus a media media query for font sizing when the screen goes below a certain width.

U3: Making notes of some unicode characters. This file will need to be changed for clarity and organization. :note;-) 'task attention'.
